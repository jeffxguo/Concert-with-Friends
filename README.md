# Concert-with-Friend

## Project Description

Concert with Friends is a web application that helps you find new friends to go to a concert with. Find concerts nearby you on the map or filtered from a list and join its group to start meeting new people.

### Who is it for? 

People who love music/going to concerts and are looking for others to join them in this event.

### What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)

Allow users to browse local concerts and join others who are attending that event by joining their virtual group. Users will be able to view the group member’s contact info once joined to connect in real life! 

### What type of data will it store? 

- Basic User’s information, eg: name, music taste
- Login credentials(username, password)
- contact info, eg: Phone number, FB contact, email
- Event group’s information, eg: event, members

### What will users be able to do with this data?

Discover and join groups for a particular event and connect with other's that are going to that event.

### What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?

Additional functionalities we can add are Spotify integrations so users can link their playlist and connect with other's who share similar music taste as well as in app messaging.
Functionalities to remove base on time constriction will be email alerts and adding the event to the user's calendar.
